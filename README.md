# Djoro monitoring Dashboard

## Prerequisites

We use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


## Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.


## Generated from angular-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project was created from the angular-seed project. See [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
